# Retail Data Clustering Project

## Description
This project focuses on clustering retail data to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. Using **RFM analysis** (Recency, Frequency, Monetary value) and clustering techniques like **K-Means**, the project identifies distinct customer groups to provide actionable business insights. The project is inspired by the tutorial: [Clustering Retail Data - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afPJeQuVeuY&t=2000s).
